# AS3 Conversion Guide

This is a work-in-progress book about converting Actionscript code to Haxe for use with OpenFL.

Please help provide feedback on the OpenFL [forums](http://community.openfl.org) or contact me directly on the OpenFL Slack chat.

I hope this continues to grow as a resource to help make Haxe and OpenFL a useful tool to you.

Thanks everyone!
