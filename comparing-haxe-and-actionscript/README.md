# Comparing Haxe and ActionScript

Since the Haxe programming language originated from an ActionScript 2.0 compiler, there are many similarities between the languages. In fact, a number of the minor differences between ActionScript 3.0 and Haxe can be explained if you understand this heritage.

However, as you look deeper, you will find that Haxe is a modern, strictly-typed language that takes inspiration from many of the best parts of ActionScript while adding many new and valuable features.
