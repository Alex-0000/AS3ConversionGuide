# Comparing Haxe and ActionScript

Since the Haxe programming language originated from an ActionScript 2.0 compiler, there are many similarities between the languages. In fact, a number of the minor differences between ActionScript 3.0 and Haxe can be explained if you understand this heritage.

However, as you look deeper, you may find that Haxe is truly a modern strictly-typed language that takes many of the best parts of ActionScript, but adds many new and valuable features beyond ActionScript's capabilities.

In this way, Haxe is not a "me too" language, but is arguably better than ActionScript 3.0. As some developers have stated, "Haxe feels like ActionScript 4.0", or "Haxe delivers everything we could have hoped for from ActionScript Next."

There is no reason to create a flame war between ActionScript and Haxe, however. Let's walk through some of the superficial details between the languages, then get into some of the deeper differences.
